How did The Gun Girls get started?

In the spring of 1974, Two punk friends named Vanessa Jones (a very mature and naughty woman) and Lori Vandercamp (who is also an actor, not just a musician) thought they might like to do an experimental punk band together. In another part of UCLA, Jenny Sparks (a future highest-paid celebrity and pop singer), Winona Townsend (a Lesbian tomboy who would later become a professional doctor), and Scarlett Williams (an electronic keyboardist and composer), and a Toys "R" Us employee named Samantha "Sammie" Isacson (who loves dolls and toys) thought they would too. And so they decided to call it, "The Gun Girls", after Vanessa saw two girls bringing guns to the university and thought it was funny and that she loved it.
