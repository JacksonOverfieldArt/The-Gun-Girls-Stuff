The Gun Girls were an American avant-garde 1980's/1990's punk music group from San Francisco, California. They were best known for their weird, strange, and silly rock/punk music. They have also collaborated with other musicians and bands such as Devo and Mark Mothersbaugh, The Residents, The Ramones, Blondie and Debbie Harry, Frank Zappa, Weird Al Yankovic, and The Go-Go's.

The Gun Girls comprised of Vanessa Jones the singer, Lori Vandercamp on lead guitar, Jenny Sparks on backing guitar, Winona Townsend on bass guitar, Scarlett Williams on electronic keyboard, and Samantha "Sammie" Isacson on drums. They disbanded in 2004 after the death of Jones from drug overdose suicide. Since then, the five other girls retired from punk music and went on to become other things, Lori Vandercamp went on to become an actress, Jenny Sparks went on to become a pop singer, Winona Townsend went on to become a doctor, Scarlett Williams went on to become a film/TV score composer, and Sammie Isacson was an employee at a Toys "R" Us store as well as a toy and doll collector. All six of them are dead. Vanessa Jones, a "bad and naughty girl", was also a visual artist, political commentator, criminal, mother, cigarette smoker, alcohol drinker, sex offender, and member of the Church of the SubGenius. Winona Townsend later died in 2015 of complications from cancer while the four other members (Lori Vandercamp, Jenny Sparks, Scarlett Williams, and Sammie Isacson) died from COVID-19 in 2020, refusing to wear face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. They did not get vaccinated against the virus at all. In animation, The Kanker Sisters from the kids cartoon Ed, Edd n Eddy were modeled after Vanessa Jones (Jane Lane from the adult cartoon Daria was also modeled after her too as well) Lori Vandercamp, and Winona Townsend, while Charlotte Pickles from the kids cartoon Rugrats was modeled after Scarlett Williams.
